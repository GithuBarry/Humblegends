//  MPRoomModel.h
//  Malperdy
//
//  This class encapsulates all of the information for a single room, including
//  its geometry for both drawing and physics. Locations of everything within a
//  a room are stored relative to the room's origin, which is the lower left corner.
// 
//  Room is a subclass of SceneNode, and so all of SceneNode's methods can be used
//  with it. This allows individual rooms and their contents to be scaled properly
//  when zooming in and out. Each element of room geometry is then stored as a child
//  scene graph node of the room.
// 
//  In theory, all the rooms in a level can be made children of a SceneNode for the
//  whole level grid. Transforming the grid should then allow for easy transformation
//  of all the room, and calling render() on the level grid SceneNode should draw all
//  of the rooms accordingly.
