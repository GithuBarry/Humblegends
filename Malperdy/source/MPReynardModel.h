//
//  This encapsulates all of the information for the character avatar.  Note how this
//  class combines physics and animation.  This is a good template for models in
//  your game.
//
//  WARNING: There are a lot of shortcuts in this design that will do not adapt well
//  to data driven design.  This demo has a lot of simplifications to make it a bit
//  easier to see how everything fits together.  However, the model classes and how
//  they are initialized will need to be changed if you add dynamic level loading.
//
//  Pay close attention to how this class designed.  Subclasses of Cocos2d classes
//  (which are all subclasses of the class Ref) should never have normal public
//  constructors.  Instead, you should organize their constructors into three parts,
//  just like we have done in this class.
//
//  NORMAL CONSTRUCTOR:
//  The standard constructor should be protected (not private).  It should only
//  initialize pointers to nullptr and primitives to their defaults (pointers are
//  not always nullptr to begin with).  It should NOT take any arguments and should
//  not allocate any memory or call any methods.
//
//  STATIC CONSTRUCTOR
//  This is a static method that allocates the object and initializes it.  If
//  initialization fails, it immediately disposes of the object.  Otherwise, it
//  returns an autoreleased object, starting the garbage collection system.
//  These methods all look the same.  You can copy-and-paste them from sample code.
//  The only difference is the init method called.
//
//  INIT METHOD
//  This is a protected method that acts like what how would normally think a
//  constructor might work.  It allocates memory and initializes all values
//  according to provided arguments.  As memory allocation can fail, this method
//  needs to return a boolean indicating whether or not initialization was
//  successful.
